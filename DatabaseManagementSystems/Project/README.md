This is the base project for the term projects of the
Database Management Systems course at the Istanbul
Technical University, Computer Engineering Department.

The term projects are Java web applications that use
an SQL database. Projects must use the
[Apache Wicket](https://wicket.apache.org/) framework.
The necessary libraries for Wicket are already included
in this project.

On the database side, projects must use JDBC drivers.
Using ORM packages like Hibernate is not allowed.
The SQLite JDBC driver is included in the project.
If you will use another database, you have to add it
to your project files and the classpath.

This project can be directly imported into Eclipse.
You can start the application by running the
"Start.java" file as a regular Java application.
This will run the application on the bundled Jetty
server. If you are using "Eclipse for Java EE",
you also have the option of installing Apache Tomcat
and deploying to it.
