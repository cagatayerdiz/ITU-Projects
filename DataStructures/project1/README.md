Project 1 Description
=====================

The aim of this homework is to use binary trees and recursion. You are asked to implement a simple **“Guess the murderer”** game. In the game, the computer will read a set of suspects with their physical properties. Then, the computer will ask Yes/No questions to a witness (you) and finally declare the result of
its investigation and report in how many steps it could determine the murderer. The set of suspects must be read from a text file named **“suspects.txt”** of which contents are given below. The format of a line is
**“Name:Height:Weight:Gender:Age:Race:EyeColor:HairType”** and each line describes a suspect. 

**Example:** Alice:tall:thin:female:young:caucasian:brown:straight

The file must be compiled smoothly in a recent version of GNU/Linux distributions (preferably lubuntu, Ubuntu, Mint or at worst case any other Debian-based distribution) and with the most recent version of g++.
